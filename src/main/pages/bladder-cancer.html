    <h1>Bladder Cancer</h1>
    <p>Bladder cancer is an anatomical classification of cancer that begins in the bladder and consequently may disturb the urinary/renal system. The most common form of bladder cancer is urothelial carcinoma, which accounts for 90% of all bladder cancer instances<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup>. Urothelial carcinoma stems in the urothelial cells that line the inside of many tissues in the urinary system, such as the bladder, urethra, and ureters. These cells may be classified as transitional cells due to their ability to shrink and expand, especially in the bladder as it fills/empties of urine. The majority of cases of bladder cancer are non-muscle-invasive (advancing no further than the urothelial lining), but they may be muscle-invasive (advancing into the surrounding muscle tissue).
    <br><br>The type of bladder cancer may be determined by how deep into the bladder lining the cancer invades. Cancer that invades only to the intermediate cells is non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, while cancer that invades the basal cell layer can be muscle-invasive urothelial cancer or squamous cell carcinoma. The grade (low-grade or high-grade) may be used as another classification, especially to determine prognosis.
    <br><br>Low-grade urothelial cancer neoplasms may manifest as long-branching papillary fronds on one or more cell layers of the urothelial lining. High-grade urothelial cancer may be more abnormal and aggressive, and may easily spread further than the urinary system (possibly into the lymphatic system).</p>
    <div class="l-div"><h3>Prognosis <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i></h3></div>
    <p>
      Prognosis for bladder cancer can depend on the stage of the cancer, age, and general health. It can also depend on whether or not the cancer is muscle-invasive, and/or whether or not the cancer cells are high-grade.
      <br><br>
      Survival rates* using typical cancer staging classifications (I-IV):<br>
      <b>Stage I (Localized Carcinoma)</b> - ~80% of people survive for more than 5+ years.<br>
      <b>Stage II (Localized)</b> - ~45% of people survive for more than 5+ years.<br>
      <b>Stage III (Regional)</b> - ~40% of people survive for more than 5+ years.<br>
      <b>Stage IV (Metastatic)</b> - ~10% of people survive for more than 5+ years.<br>

    <div class="l-div"><h3>Symptoms / Diagnosis <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard"></i></h3></div>
    <p>
      Symptoms that may correlate to bladder cancer<sup><a href="#sources">[3]</a></sup>:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Trouble urinating</li>
        <li>Frequent urination</li>
        <li>Less bladder control</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Abdominal or bone pain</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
      </ul><p>
      Screening/testing for bladder cancer may be practiced on patients with an above-average risk or further reason. Screening may include:
      <br><br><b>Hematuria Test</b><br>
      A test to check for the presence of red blood cells (blood) in urine. Cells may be observed under a microscope or from a test strip.
      <br><b>Cystoscopy</b><br>
      A test to check the bladder for abnormal regions via a thin tube with a lens (a cystoscope). The cystoscope is inserted into the urethra.
      <br><b>Urine Cytology</b><br>
      A test in which a urine sample is observed under a microscope to check for abnormal cells.
      <br><b>CT Urogram / IVP (intravenous pyelogram)</b><br>
      A test in which dye is injected into the veins, followed by multiple CT scans to check the function of the urinary tract. An IVP is similar, but many X-RAY scans of multiple urinary organs are taken after the dye's injection at certain times.
      <br><b>Biopsy</b><br>
      A test in which a sample of cells are taken out of the bladder to be observed for abnormal cells.
